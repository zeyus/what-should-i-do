# What Should I Do?

An extremely simple bootstrap and jquery project that generates a response from lists of parts.

It's just a fun, silly idea that might help focus on the important things. Or not, it's not a psychologist, and neither am I.

I did this whole thing in like 10/15 mins, so this does not constitute part of my programming portfolio nor should be taken as an indication of my best work ;P
